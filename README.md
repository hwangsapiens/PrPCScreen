Genome-wide CRISPRa Screen for PrPC Modulators

Code Repository

This repository contains the analysis code used for processing, quality control, statistical analysis, and visualization of data generated in the study:

“Genome-wide arrayed CRISPR activation screen for prion protein modulators.”

The scripts reproduce all major analyses and figures derived from the primary TR-FRET screen, secondary validations, and genomic localization analyses.

Repository Overview

This repository includes:

R scripts for processing and analyzing the arrayed genome-wide CRISPRa screen

MATLAB script for genomic localization analysis and Manhattan plot generation

Example input/output file formats and documentation to enable reuse and reproducibility

The code is organized to reflect the logical analysis workflow used in the manuscript.
